          <h2>The Responsibility of the Writer</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Have you ever felt like the shooter video game you're playing is strikingly realistic? <i>Maybe that's because it's actually 
            based on real events.</i><br/><br/>
            I wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/@golden2402/the-responsibility-of-the-writer-8a45b6441750" target="_blank">blog post</a>
            highlighting the ever-dwindling line between fact and fiction. Writers in media have always taken historical events and
            translated them to fit the criteria for their projects' stories. Are we writing the future using the fictional stories 
            of today?

          <h2>Social Media Standards for Men and Women</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Do you feel inclined to post on Instagram? Do you feel pressured to post certain kinds of thing on your social media pages?
            My ENGL 3844 discussion group and I have created a 
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/yuqin-feng/possible-different-social-media-standards-for-guys-and-girls" target="_blank">podcast</a>
            detailing our group's perspectives on the different social media stanards for guys and girls. We invite several other 
            students from Virginia Tech to voice their opinion on the matter.
